# Mentorship Tools as XLSForms

A tool used to generate [XLSForms](https://xlsform.org/en/) for the [PEPFAR SIMS](https://learn.pepfar.net/courses/course-v1:learn-pepfar-net+DSY132+2022/about)
quality assessment tools. The generated XLSForms can then be loaded to any
[ODK ecosystem](https://getodk.github.io/xforms-spec/) tools and used to
undertake the assessment.

## Usage

Run the following command on your terminal from the root directory of the
project to use the tool.

```bash
python -m sims_xls_forms
```

The generated XLSForms can be found on the `out` directory.
